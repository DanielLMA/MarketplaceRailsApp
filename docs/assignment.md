Create a zip file of this directory called,
  {Fullname}_T2A2.zip
A sample command that can be run in Mac OS X/Linux terminal to achieve creation of the zip file is as follows,

zip -r {Fullname}_T2A2.zip {Fullname}_T2A2
Submit this zip file in Canvas
Example

If your name is Luke Skywalker,

The directory you create will be called LukeSkywalker_T2A2
  mkdir LukeSkywalker_T2A2
Organize all the files for submission in this directory

Deadline
You are responsible for submitting this assessment before the deadline date/time. Your assessment submission-time is set and logged by Canvas once your entire submission is uploaded and submitted in the system. This submission-time is used to verify on time submission or determine if you are liable for any late submission penalties.

Slow internet speeds, long submission/upload times, delay in uploading, etc are NOT grounds for special consideration (i.e. for waiving of any applicable late penalty).

Remember for any valid special consideration request, relevant and full support documentation MUST be provided. The outcome of the special consideration request will be determined by Academic management and not your Educators.
